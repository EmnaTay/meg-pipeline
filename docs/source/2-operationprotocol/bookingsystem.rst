-----------------------------

Provide your `netID` to the MEG scientists for you to have access to the lab booking calendar.


.. warning::

   While scheduling your experiment, avoid rush hours 8:30am and 5:30pm, and friday prayer time, as more noise can be introduced into the data due to outside movement.
   All bookings should not happen on a monday morning, as Helium refill is scheduled for monday mornings (9:00 am till 10:30 am)
   and it is not possible to acquire data during this period.
